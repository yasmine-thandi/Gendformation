**Team Members: Yasmine Thandi**

**Project Description:**

   The project I have decided to develop is a mini-database webpage containing the information regarding who is involved in  gender equity and inclusion, the definition of gender equity, where and when it ocurs, and why and how it is important to create inclusion all over the world. The user will be able to explore the world of Gendformation as they click buttons throughout the webpage, and become knowledgeable regarding the transformation of gender equality and representation globally. Additionally, users will be able to access additional helpful resources regarding gender equity in the database. To maximize usefulness of the information provided, there will be a comment section for users to be able to communicate with others reagrding the concept, using client and server-side coding.
